## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Miguell390/geminiapp.git
   cd geminiapp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Setup Dependencies & API Keys

> **Note:** Sensitive files such as environment variables and API keys are intentionally excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.  
> You must set up your own dependencies and provide your own API keys to run the application.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables (including any necessary API keys).
- If you require a database, copy `database.sample.json` to create your own database file.

## Configuration

- Update the `.env` file with your configuration, including API keys and other secrets.
- Review and update any required settings according to your deployment environment.

## Usage

### Run Locally

Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start (by default on port 3000, or as specified in your `.env`).

### API

Refer to the code in `server.js` and the `src/` directory for API endpoints and chatbot logic.

## Development

- Main entry point: `server.js`
- Source code: `src/`
- Static files: `public/`

To run in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Docker Deployment

This application includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy containerized deployment.

Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
